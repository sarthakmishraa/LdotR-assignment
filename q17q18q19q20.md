This is my ML side project (I did this in 2023) where I took a dataset and performed all the steps:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Building

Dataset - Bike Rental Prediction

Objective - Prediciting no of bikes that will be rented based on weather, date, time, humidity, windspeed, working day or not
