## Branching Strategy

1. There should be a master branch which is the one deployed.

2. If a new feature needs to be added then a new branch should be created seperately.

## A good method to push new features to a common repository is practised by following some rules.

1. Clone the master branch and code your new feature locally, when you're done then update your local codebase again with the updated master branch code to avoid conflicts.
As a developer might take few weeks to build a new feature but by that time new changes must have occured and sync is needed to make sure the new feature does not arise conflicts with the updated code.

2. Do not push incomplete features as it might break the app and commenting out incomplete code does not look good as well.
